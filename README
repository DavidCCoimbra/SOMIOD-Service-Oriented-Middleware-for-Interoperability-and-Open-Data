Developed in C#, this middleware supports multiple applications and allows for the creation, modification, listing, and deletion of resources through a REST API. The resources include application, module, data, and subscription, each with a unique ID, name, and creation date. Subscriptions support two types of events, creation or deletion or both, and an MQTT endpoint for firing notifications. Transferred and stored data are in XML format, and the middleware persists resources and data on a database.
